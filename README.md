# FGO-Simulator
An informational website and pull simulator of the popular mobile game Fate Grand Order. Made for a friend, Spring 2020

## Background
My friend needed help making a raw HTML-CSS-JS website as a project for a class. He told me he would pay me two $12 with popeyes meals, 
I happily obliged. This site was made in 3 hours and includes a homepage, a page for each FGO class, and a pull simulator that mimics a generic FGO
puller, using the data provided by Nisegami's [fgo.json](https://gist.github.com/nisegami/d7eab484484ae8ee1958a09f73207fac). Note that it
IS NOT the same as a real puller since they frequently update chances for characters, but rather uses a simple formula to determine probability
of a pull based on star count.
